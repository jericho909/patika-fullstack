        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large Brahmin steaks (or beef steaks, if Brahmin is unavailable)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup beef broth</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Rub the Brahmin steaks with olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Grill the steaks for 4-5 minutes per side, or until cooked to your desired level of doneness. Remove from heat and let rest for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>While the steaks are resting, heat the remaining olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute, until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the sliced onion, bell pepper, and mushrooms to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and lightly browned, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the Worcestershire sauce and beef broth, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Simmer for 2-3 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li>Remove the skillet from heat and stir in the butter until melted and incorporated.</li>
            <li>Slice the grilled Brahmin steaks against the grain and serve with the sautéed vegetables on top.</li>
            <li>Garnish with chopped fresh parsley before serving.</li>
        </ol>
